    <p>Most programmers have an intuitive understanding of general equivalences
    between programs. For instance, the branches of an if-then-else block can be
    swapped, as long as its condition is negated --- regardless of what the
    branches or condition look like. Such propositional program equivalences are
    useful to verify that a refactoring operation preserves program semantics.</p>
    <p>Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT) has proven to be a very powerful framework for
    verifying propositional program equivalences, either through manual equational
    reasoning or by automated equivalence checking. In recent years, the focus has
    been on a deterministic fragment of KAT that models imperative programs very
    closely, known as Guarded KAT (GKAT). GKAT has a rich equational theory, which
    can be used to prove many useful equivalences between imperative programs.
    What's more, GKAT equivalences can be checked mechanically and efficiently.</p>
    <p>We will survey recent advances surrounding GKAT. Topics discussed include both
    positive and negative results about GKAT's expressivity, logical completeness,
    extensions, and decision procedures, as well as connections to decompilation
    and a conjecture of Milner that was recently resolved.</p>
    <p>This talk will cover joint work with Balder ten Cate, Justin Hsu, Nate Foster,
    Dexter Kozen, David E. Narváez, Nico Naus, Wojciech Różowski, Todd Schmid,
    Alexandra Silva, Steffen Smolka, and Cheng Zhang.</p>

    <div class="read-more">
        <p>We first recall a functorial framework for automata theory bridging the algebraic 
        and coalgebraic approach. Various forms of automata can be seen as functors from an 
        input category -- describing the structure of the input, e.g. words or trees -- to an 
        output category -- describing the values produced by a run in such an automaton. For example, 
        deterministic, nondeterministic, weighted automata or transducers over some input alphabet 
        A can all be seen as automata with effects, or functors from the same input category 
        (parametric on A) to some Kleisli category -- modelling the corresponding side-effect: the 
        Kleisli category of the powerset monad for nondeterministic automata, vector spaces for weighted
         automata over a field, etc. The framework allows for generic minimization and learning algorithms
          and can be extended from automata over words to tree automata, by suitably modifying the input
          category. In the rest of the talk we focus on how to model, minimize and learn Mealy machines in 
          this setting. We also discuss the relation with recent work on effectful Mealy machines by Bonchi 
          et al.</p>
