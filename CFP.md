# OVERVIEW

[FSCD](https://fscd-conference.org/) covers all aspects of formal structures for computation and deduction, from theoretical foundations to applications. Building on two communities — RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications) — FSCD embraces their core topics and broadens their scope to closely related areas in logic, models of computation, semantics, and verification in new challenging areas.

The suggested (but not exclusive) list of topics for submission is:

## 1. Calculi
- Rewriting systems (string, term, higher-order, nominal, graph, conditional, modulo, infinitary, etc.)
- Lambda calculus
- Logics (first-order, higher-order, equational, modal, linear, classical, constructive, etc.)
- Proof theory (natural deduction, sequent calculus, proof nets, etc.)
- Type theory and logical frameworks
- Homotopy type theory
- Process algebras (synchronous, asynchronous, static and dynamic semantics with and without time, etc.)
- Quantum calculi

## 2. Methods in Computation and Deduction
- Type systems (polymorphism, dependent, recursive, intersection, session, etc.)
- Induction, coinduction
- Matching, unification, completion, orderings
- Strategies (normalisation, completeness, etc.)
- Tree automata
- Model building and model checking
- Proof search and theorem proving
- Constraint solving and decision procedures

## 3. Semantics
- Operational semantics and abstract machines
- Game semantics and applications
- Domain theory and categorical models
- Quantitative models (timing, probabilities, etc.)
- Quantum computation and emerging models of computation

## 4. Algorithmic Analysis and Transformations of Formal Systems
- Type inference and type checking
- Abstract interpretation
- Complexity analysis and implicit computational complexity
- Checking termination, confluence, derivational complexity and related properties
- Symbolic computation

## 5. Tools and Applications
- Programming and proof environments
- Verification tools
- Proof assistants and interactive theorem provers
- Applications in industry
- Applications of formal systems in other sciences
- Applications of formal systems in education

## 6. Formal Systems for Modelling and Verification in New Challenging Areas
- Certification
- Security
- Blockchain
- Databases
- Deep learning and machine learning algorithms
- Planning

# PUBLICATION

The proceedings will be published as an electronic volume in the **Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)** of Schloss Dagstuhl.  
All LIPIcs proceedings are **open access**.

---

# SPECIAL ISSUE

There will be a special issue of **Logical Methods in Computer Science** of selected papers. More details will be provided later.

---

# SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

The submission site is:  
👉 [https://submissions.floc26.org/fscd/](https://submissions.floc26.org/fscd/)

Submissions must be formatted using the [LIPIcs style files](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author) and submitted via HotCRP.

Submissions can be made in two categories: **regular research papers** and **system descriptions**. Please indicate in the submission page in HotCRP and on the first page of the paper which category you are submitting.

- Regular research papers are limited to **15 pages**, excluding references and appendices. They must present original, unpublished research not submitted elsewhere.
- System descriptions are limited to **15 pages**, excluding references. Shorter papers are welcome and given equal consideration.  
  A system description must present new software tools, or significantly new versions of such tools, in which FSCD topics play an important role.  
  An archive of the code with installation and usage instructions must be submitted, and a webpage for online experimentation should be provided.

One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the work **in person** at the conference.  
If in-person attendance is not possible, **online presentation** will be arranged, but in-person registration will still be required.

# BEST PAPER AWARD BY JUNIOR RESEARCHERS

The programme committee will select a paper in which at least one author is a **junior researcher**, i.e., either a student or someone whose PhD award date is less than three years from the first day of the meeting.  
When submitting the paper, other authors should declare to the PC Chair that at least **50% of the contribution** is made by the junior researcher(s).
